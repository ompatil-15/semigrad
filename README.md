# Semigrad: A Simplified Autograd for Scalars

Semigrad is a lightweight automatic differentiation library designed specifically for scalar computations. Inspired by the principles of autograd, Semigrad focuses on simplicity and efficiency, making it ideal for educational purposes and small-scale projects. It leverages the concept of backpropagation to compute gradients, allowing users to easily optimize scalar functions without the complexity of full-fledged frameworks.
